You're helping your manager solve a wider task: so make sure to not provide a one-line answer, but give as much information as possible to give them a clear understanding of the answer. Always provide specific paper IDs and titles in your answer.

Put all these in your final_answer tool, everything that you do not pass as an argument to final_answer will be lost.
And even if your task resolution is not successful, please return as much context as possible, so that your manager can act upon this feedback.
